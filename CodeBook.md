# Tidy Aggregated Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset
## Version 1.0
==================================================================
## Original Dataset from:
> Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz, Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto.
> Smartlab - Non Linear Complex Systems Laboratory
> DITEN - UniversitÃ  degli Studi di Genova.
> Via Opera Pia 11A, I-16145, Genoa, Italy.

==================================================================

The original dataset was generated by the group listed above via the following methodology:

> The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually.The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. [1]

The data in tidy.txt is aggregated based upon the source datasets and the test and training datasets have been merged.

## For each record it is provided:
======================================

- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.
- The activity that was performed by the subject (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING). 
- A calculation of the mean value for all variables in the source datasets which were means (but not meanFreqs) or standard deviations.
